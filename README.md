HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY

"NEXTPLANET" is an innovative project aimed at addressing the lack of engaging and interactive information about habitable exoplanets. With the goal of inspiring curiosity about life beyond Earth, this initiative seeks to educate the public about the complexities of exoplanetary data and dispel common misconceptions. By providing accurate information and fostering scientific understanding, NEXTPLANET bridges the gap between space agencies and the general public, igniting enthusiasm for future space missions. Additionally, it encourages contemplation of the potential for human habitation on exoplanets, preparing society for the possibilities of colonization. In doing so, NEXTPLANET aspires to cultivate a greater appreciation for the vast universe and its mysteries, driving a newfound interest in space exploration.

What have we created?

We've created an interactive Exoplanet model designed for everyone. This innovative tool goes beyond mere entertainment; it enables users to explore and understand the potential existence of life in distant corners of the universe. By showcasing how life might appear and endure in such environments, the model educates individuals about the complexities of living on exoplanets. This knowledge prepares us for the future prospect of human colonization.

In our model, users can experience a lot of things that should be situated in an exoplanet. We have added some models from NASA resources like space shuttle, Spacecraft, Rovers, and other models, which make our Exoplanet habitable.

We created a museum where we exhibit space-related objects such as some exoplanets 3D models, space satellites, the James Webb telescope, Voyager 2, ISS (International Space Station), Lunar module provided by NASA. Users can visit the museum and see detailed information about these Exhibit models.
